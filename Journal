6/13: 
Created a google doc with project goals and found the parts and headset that would work with my budget. I spent some time googling trying to figure out how to connect the Runcam Nano to the headset (RCA to AV adapter) and thinking through how I would power everything. 
Time spent: 2 hrs

6/24:
Created a mockup of the headset and designed the holder for the camera (both 3D printed parts), theorycrafted on how to attach a battery pack to the back (strap it with some velcro loops lol)
Also looking up how to connect a wireless camera to the headset (as opposed to just one hardwired camera)
Time spent: 2hrs 

6/25
Further looked into how to connect wireless cameras to the headset to make one self contained wireless module for hard to reach areas, along with the other camera attached to the headset. 
Fount a suitable video transmittion system for this and calculated the BoM for all the parts (if I need anything else I'm cooked, this is already $146 ;-;). 
Time spent: 1.5 hrs
Goals for tmrw: make the case for the wireless module, check how to switch between cameras, add off switch for the wireless module (or just a battery connection you can disconnect because buttons might push us over $150)
