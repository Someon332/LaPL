6/13: 
Created a google doc with project goals and found the parts and headset that would work with my budget. I spent some time googling trying to figure out how to connect the Runcam Nano to the headset (RCA to AV adapter) and thinking through how I would power everything. 
Time spent: 2 hrs

6/24:
Created a mockup of the headset and designed the holder for the camera (both 3D printed parts), theorycrafted on how to attach a battery pack to the back (strap it with some velcro loops lol)
Also looking up how to connect a wireless camera to the headset (as opposed to just one hardwired camera)
Time spent: 2hrs
