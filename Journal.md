6/13: 

Created a google doc with project goals and found the parts and headset that would work with my budget. I spent some time googling trying to figure out how to connect the Runcam Nano to the headset (RCA to AV adapter) and thinking through how I would power everything. 

Time spent: 2 hrs


6/24:

Created a mockup of the headset and designed the holder for the camera (both 3D printed parts), theorycrafted on how to attach a battery pack to the back (strap it with some velcro loops lol)
Also looking up how to connect a wireless camera to the headset (as opposed to just one hardwired camera)

Time spent: 2hrs 

The headset model:

The wired camera mount model:

Further looked into how to connect wireless cameras to the headset to make one self contained wireless module for hard to reach areas, along with the other camera attached to the headset. 
Fount a suitable video transmittion system for this and calculated the BoM for all the parts (if I need anything else I'm cooked, this is already $146 ;-;). 
Time spent: 1.5 hrs

The wireless video transmission system + camera amazon page:

Modeled the wireless camera mount. I designed everything to just slot in roughly (maybe to be held down by a little dab of hot glue) since this version is just a proof of concept and the parts can be reused for future versions, helping to keep the costs lower in the future. 
Also, I spent some more time worrying about the connection from the wired camera to the headset, but everything looks like it's fine. If something dosen't work, I'll find out when all the parts arrive I guess. 

Time spent: 3 hrs
